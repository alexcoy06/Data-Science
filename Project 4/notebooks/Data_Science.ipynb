This dataset provides a rich source of information, covering job titles, estimated salaries, job descriptions, company ratings, and essential company details such as location, size, and industry. By conducting a thorough analysis of this dataset, we aim to gain valuable insights into the job market, identify key trends, and understand what to expect when job hunting or researching career opportunities in the data science field.\n",

        "To make these insights accessible and actionable, the analysis will be visually represented on a self-made website. This approach ensures that the findings are not only informative but also easily interpretable, catering to a wide audience ranging from job seekers to industry analysts. The goal is to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of job market trends, helping users make informed career decisions based on reliable data.\n",
