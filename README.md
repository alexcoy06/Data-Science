## About Me

I'm currently undergoing an intensive data science bootcamp with TripleTen, where I'm honing my skills in Python programming, data analysis, machine learning, and more. Through this portfolio, I aim to demonstrate my growth and expertise in the field while sharing my personal approach to analytical challenges.

## Repository Structure

- **Project1:** I'll analyze a dataset of movies and shows with Python and Pandas to showcase the highly rated programs from the Golden Age of television.
- **Project2:** The task entails analyzing a modified Instacart dataset for insights into customer shopping habits, involving data cleaning, and addressing key questions.

## Deployment

This project was completed using the `Visual Studio Code` editor. I utilized `Anaconda Individual Edition` with all standard settings. To ensure compatibility, I installed the `ipykernel` package using `Anaconda Navigator`. Additionally, I downloaded the following extensions for `Visual Studio Code`: `Python` from `Microsoft`.

For your convenience, I have the **Jupyter Notebook** directly connected to a **Google Colab**. You can simply click on the **Google Colab** link to access and test each **Jupyter Notebook**. You can find the link in the upper left corner.

**Note:** When using `Google Colab`, make sure to take note of the instructions and change the value for the import.

## Improvement

Will be posted as needed.
